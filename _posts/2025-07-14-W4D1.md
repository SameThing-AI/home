## Daily Schedule: Strategic Pivot Session

### Main Work Session
**Start Time:** 9:05 AM  
**End Time:** 3:41 PM  
**Duration:** 6 hours 36 minutes

## The Mindset: Unwavering Determination

### The Core Philosophy
> **"There's always hope in trying. Let's just do it."**

This statement captures the **essential startup mentality** - persistence in the face of uncertainty and the willingness to keep experimenting when initial approaches aren't yielding results.

## Strategic Market Pivot

### The Response Reality Check
> **"I don't see any response from people within 1-100 employee companies. Let's go for the next iteration and target people working at mid-sized companies for an opinion"**

This demonstrates **mature startup thinking** - recognizing when a strategy isn't working and **pivoting systematically** rather than abandoning efforts entirely.

### The New Outreach Strategy

#### Public Company Hypothesis
- [x] **Reach out to people from 1-100 PUBLIC companies. I want to try this, because I feel this'll take out the fake companies out of the way if someone is public. Need to validate this chain of thought**

**Strategic Reasoning:**
1. **Quality Filter:** Public companies have verified legitimacy
2. **Professional Standards:** Higher likelihood of professional communication
3. **Serious Prospects:** Real companies with actual hiring needs
4. **Credibility Validation:** Removes uncertainty about company authenticity

#### Scale Expansion to Mid-Sized Companies
- [x] **Reach out to at-least recruiters at mid-sized companies (>100 people) (500 today)**
  - **Target Expansion:** Companies with 100+ employees
  - **Daily Goal:** 500 recruiter contacts
  - **Strategic Rationale:** Larger companies may have more structured hiring processes and budget for innovative solutions

## YC Founder Education

### Critical Learning Session
- [x] **https://www.ycombinator.com/library/66-biggest-mistakes-first-time-founders-make - Good video. Output- Even if crappy make something some people will use then move ahead.**

#### The Key Insight
**"Even if crappy make something some people will use then move ahead"**

This **fundamental startup principle** validates the current approach:
1. **MVP over Perfection:** Launch with functional product rather than perfect product
2. **User Feedback Loop:** Real user engagement beats theoretical planning
3. **Iterative Development:** Improve based on actual usage, not assumptions

#### Strategic Validation
This YC wisdom **directly supports** the current strategy of:
- Continuing outreach despite low response rates
- Improving the demo based on real feedback
- Building while learning rather than planning indefinitely

## Major Demo Development

### Core Platform Improvements
- [x] **Work on the demo**

#### Authentication System Fixes
- [x] **Fixed login issue for both recruiter and candidate side**
  - Resolved critical user experience barriers
  - Ensured seamless access for both user types
  - Established reliable authentication flow

#### Assessment Framework Simplification
- [x] **Fix the part where there are multiple options to assess someone. It should be two options either a hardcoded assessment that I create or a custom not the enhanced/video bs that is happening right now**

**Strategic Simplification:**
1. **Hardcoded Assessment:** Standardized, tested evaluation templates
2. **Custom Assessment:** AI-generated, role-specific evaluations
3. **Eliminated Complexity:** Removed confusing "enhanced/video" options that diluted user experience

#### Infrastructure Validation
- [x] **Make sure that the database connection still works**
  - Verified MongoDB integration stability
  - Ensured data persistence reliability
  - Maintained platform technical foundation

#### Recruiter Experience Enhancement
- [x] **Recruiter should be able to view the assessment**
  - Implemented assessment viewing functionality
  - Enhanced recruiter workflow and usability
  - Provided essential feedback loop for assessment quality

## Outstanding Development Priorities

### AI System Enhancement
- [ ] **Fix the AI system. Ask the AI to come up with sandboxes, incredibly interactive assessments**
  - Implementation of **Chaos Sandbox concept** from W3D2
  - Transition from generic to **interactive, scenario-based** assessments
  - Revolutionary assessment methodology integration

### Intelligent Support System
- [ ] **Make an AI chatbot that understands the question that is created and can answer any question related to the question**
  - Context-aware chatbot development
  - Question-specific support system
  - Enhanced candidate guidance and assistance

### Content Management
- [ ] **Update the website w/ regular updates**
  - Maintain current content and progress documentation
  - Ensure professional web presence
  - Regular communication with potential users and investors

### YC Application Research
- [ ] **Can we find actual YC applications? how do they look?**
  - Benchmarking against successful applications
  - Understanding application quality standards
  - Strategic preparation for competitive submission

### Streaming Commitment Strategy
- [ ] **Stay on stream for the entirety of our workday. Listen to music if you want to but stay on.**
  - **Accountability mechanism** through public work sessions
  - **Transparency building** with potential users and community
  - **Productivity enhancement** through social pressure and documentation
